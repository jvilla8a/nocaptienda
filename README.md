## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a StoreApp built using Vite, React, and data scraping from another web app. The StoreApp is designed to fetch and display data from a web application using web scraping techniques. This readme file will guide you through the setup and usage of the application.

## Prerequisites

To run the StoreApp, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the StoreApp up and running on your local machine:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    bashCopy code

    `git clone <repository-url>`

2.  Navigate to the project's root directory:

    bashCopy code

    `cd storeapp`

3.  Install the project dependencies by running:

    Copy code

    `npm install`

4.  Configure the scraping functionality:

    - Open the `src/scraping.js` file and modify the scraping logic according to your requirements. You can use libraries like `cheerio` or `puppeteer` for web scraping.
    - Update the scraping logic to target the specific elements you want to scrape from the web app and retrieve the desired data.

5.  Start the development server:

    arduinoCopy code

    `npm run dev`

6.  The StoreApp should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

Once the StoreApp is running, you can use it to fetch and display data from the web app you have configured in the scraping logic. The application provides a user interface that allows you to interact with the scraped data.
